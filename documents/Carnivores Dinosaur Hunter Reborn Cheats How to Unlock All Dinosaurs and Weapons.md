To use cheats in Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn, you need to edit the game's configuration file. You can find it in the following location:
 `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC\Carnivores Dinosaur Hunter Reborn\config.cfg` 
Open the file with a text editor and look for the following lines:
 `unlocked_dinos = 0
unlocked_weapons = 0` 
Change the values from 0 to 1 to unlock all the dinosaurs and weapons in the game. Save the file and launch the game. You should now be able to hunt any dinosaur with any weapon you want.
 
Note that using cheats may affect your achievements and leaderboard rankings, so use them at your own risk. Also, make sure to backup your original config file before making any changes.
  
If you want to have more fun in Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn, you can also try some other cheats that can modify the game's settings. For example, you can change the weather, the time of day, the gravity, and the dinosaur behavior. To do this, you need to edit the same config file as before and look for the following lines:
 `weather = 0
time_of_day = 0
gravity = 1
dino_aggression = 1` 
You can change the values of these lines to alter the game's parameters. Here is what each line does and what values you can use:
 
- `weather`: This determines the weather condition in the game. You can use values from 0 to 3, where 0 is clear, 1 is cloudy, 2 is rainy, and 3 is foggy.
- `time_of_day`: This determines the time of day in the game. You can use values from 0 to 3, where 0 is dawn, 1 is day, 2 is dusk, and 3 is night.
- `gravity`: This determines the gravity level in the game. You can use any value you want, where higher values mean stronger gravity and lower values mean weaker gravity. For example, if you use a value of 0.5, you will be able to jump higher and farther.
- `dino_aggression`: This determines the aggression level of the dinosaurs in the game. You can use any value you want, where higher values mean more aggressive dinosaurs and lower values mean less aggressive dinosaurs. For example, if you use a value of 0, the dinosaurs will ignore you and not attack you.

After changing these values, save the file and launch the game. You should now be able to enjoy a different experience in Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn.
